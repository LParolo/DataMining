We may also suppose that , although the students may belong to different specialization that they are required to attend a course in Physics as it is useful in many different areas of science (even though I would have expected that math would be required as prerequisited for Physics and Chemistry). \n",

    "Well the first 2 rules make a lot of sense. The first rule in particular is the association between a 3-itemset of 3 episodes of Star Wars with the first Star Wars movie. This make sense as we can expecte that Star Wars movies fans do not miss any episode, and also because the movies narrate one single long story and consequently the public will tende to not miss a piece of the story. The second rule also represents the same, but the first itemset is a 2-itemset and \"Raiders of the lost ark\" is not present, maybe it was the least succesfull episode?! The third has a 2 itemset with one of the Star War episode and Pulp Fiction with Star Wars(1977). This makes a litle less sense, as Pulp Fiction is not the same genre as Star Wars (in fact it has a lower Support compared to the 4th association rule which has Toy Story and Star Wars episode. Toy Story in my opinion is somewhat closer as genre to Star Wars than Pulp Fiction).\n",
    "The reason why we have among the association with the stronget confidence other movies other than Star Wars episodes may be that are all high suffesfully movies. FOr example Toy Story, Pulp Fiction, Silence of the Lambs, Twelve MOnkeys, The Godfather, are some of the most famous Hollywood movies ever. Therefore is more probable that people have watched them.

    "The reason why there are only few rules with more than three items may be that we are dealing with 100000 different movies ,and therefore the purchasing decision made by customers are very scattered among the database. With a minimun support treshold of 30% means that 3 out of 10 people have seen the combination of those movies, and if all the movies had the same probbility to be watched, each movie had a probability of only 0,0003%, which is ridicolously small( and the probability of exactly those 3 movies would be immensily smaller). Therefore I think that a treshold of 30% as support, is already significant: it means that those movies are exceptionally succesfull and that they may (as for the Star Wars saga) have something that make more probable for people to whatch all the movies in that precise itemset. In fact the confidence are pretty high for the first rules."
